                    I am currently living in Germany. I got interested in programming when I was still young. My first magic moment with a computer
                    happened when I built my own at the age of 7. To be honest, I wanted to build Darth Vaders mask... Well
                    it turned into a full desktop computer.
                    <br> The time pasted on and I got more and more interested in the software. I started to do simple web
                    stuff now and then since it is easy accessible. With 16 I got more seriously into programming and since
                    then I continued to look into different languages and technologies. Web development is still something
                    I do the most often and enjoy the most right now.

                    I am skilled in web-development, using languages like HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, Javascript, PHP.
                    <br> Next to web-development, I have also experience with languages like Python, C# and a little bit
                    of Java.
                    <br> Whenever I work on a project, I use Git in combination with GitHub to manage my code effectively.

                    I went to school in Germany and graduated in 2017.
                    <br> All I have known about programming till this point is self tought. I am planning to study computer
                    science later this year in order to get a job in the industry in the near future.
